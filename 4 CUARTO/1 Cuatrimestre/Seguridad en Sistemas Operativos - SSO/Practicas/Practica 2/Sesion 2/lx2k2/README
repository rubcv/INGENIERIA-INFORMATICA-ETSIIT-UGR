The lx2k2 virus is for demonstration and academic purposes only.
It is ment to explore the possibilities of a root kit/virus combination.
Do not actually use this virus to hack a system.

This virus was created for the Academic Underground.

C0ded by Macabre

Note: There is a really crappy cleaner included that will extract
the original executible back out of an infected file.  Make sure
the virus sizes are correct becuase the cleaner does no error
checking.
